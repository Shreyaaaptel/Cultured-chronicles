                    <h3>Holika Dahan</h3>
                    <p>Holika Dahan, also known as Holi, is a Hindu festival celebrated every year in India and other parts of the world. The festival commemorates the victory of good over evil and the arrival of spring. According to legend, the festival is associated with the story of Prahlad, a young boy who was a devotee of Lord Vishnu, and his evil father Hiranyakashipu. Hiranyakashipu's sister, Holika, was granted immunity to fire and attempted to kill Prahlad by sitting with him in a burning pyre. However, due to the intervention of Lord Vishnu, Prahlad emerged unscathed, while Holika was burnt to ashes. The festival is celebrated by lighting bonfires on the night before Holi, symbolizing the victory of good over evil.</p>

                    <h3>Mahabharat</h3>
                    <p>The Mahabharata is a Hindu epic that recounts the story of a dynastic feud between two sets of cousins, the Kauravas and the Pandavas. The conflict arises from the Kauravas' refusal to share the kingdom with the Pandavas, who are exiled to the forest for many years. Upon their return, the Pandavas demand their rightful share of the kingdom, which leads to a long and brutal war. The battle culminates in the famous Kurukshetra War, which sees both sides suffer heavy losses. Ultimately, the Pandavas emerge victorious and establish their rule, but not without facing numerous challenges and moral dilemmas. The Mahabharata also includes numerous subplots and philosophical discourses on topics such as dharma, karma, and the nature of reality.</p>
