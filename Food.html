                    <h3>Spices & herbs</h3>
                    <p>Spices and herbs are an integral part of Indian cuisine, adding aroma, flavor, and complexity to dishes. India is a treasure trove of spices and herbs, including turmeric, cumin, coriander, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, ginger, and garlic. These ingredients are not only used for cooking, but also for medicinal purposes in Ayurvedic medicine. India's rich and diverse climate provides an ideal environment for cultivating these aromatic plants, making it a global leader in the production and export of spices and herbs.India's rich and diverse climate provides an ideal environment for cultivating these aromatic plants, making it a global leader in the production and export of spices and herbs.</p>

                    <h3>Foods & Festival</h3>
                    <p>Festival foods are an essential part of Indian culture, as each region celebrates its own unique festivals with special dishes. For example, during Diwali, the festival of lights, families prepare sweets such as ladoos, barfis, and gulab jamuns, while during Holi, the festival of colors, people make savory snacks like gujiya and mathri. In the southern state of Tamil Nadu, Pongal, a harvest festival, is celebrated with a sweet rice dish also called Pongal, while in the northern state of Punjab, makki di roti and sarson da saag (cornmeal bread and mustard greens) are a staple during the winter festival of Lohri. These festival foods are not just a culinary delight, but also a symbol of cultural and religious identity, bringing people together to celebrate and cherish their traditions.</p>
